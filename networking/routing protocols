A) OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)  
OSPF is a routing protocol where routers constantly tell each other about every link in the network.  
This lets every router build a complete map of the whole network, like a GPS map.  
Using that map, each router calculates the shortest and fastest path to every destination using the Dijkstra algorithm.  
It’s fast, accurate, and great for medium and large networks.

B) Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
EIGRP is a Cisco-only routing protocol that mixes the best parts of different algorithms.
Routers share routes and measure things like bandwidth and delay to figure out the best path.  
The DUAL algorithm helps it converge quickly and prevents loops.  It’s more efficient and smarter than RIP.

C) BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)
BGP is the main routing protocol of the entire Internet. It lets networks like ISPs exchange routing information. 
Instead of picking the shortest path, BGP looks at entire routes (AS paths) and makes decisions based on policies, preferences, or business rules. 
BGP is how data knows which path to take across the world.

D) RIP (Routing Information Protocol):
RIP is a very simple routing protocol that chooses paths based on hop count.   
Each router tells its neighbors how many hops away each network is.   
It works for small networks but doesn’t scale because the max number of hops is only 15, and updates are slow.
RIP is also outdated because it’s slow, can’t scale, uses a dumb metric (hop count), and only works for tiny networks. Anything bigger than a small LAN will break RIP.
