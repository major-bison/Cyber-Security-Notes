The OSI Model was created as a standard for different computer networks to talk with each other. 
It breaks networking into 7 layers that assists us how data travels from one device to another.

Layer 1 - Physical (My understanding)

The physical manifestation of network Connection. It refers to hardware and signals that they carry ( eletical wires, radio signals, Bluetooth, optical lasers) that uses binary digits
or in bits to transfer data. Examples include optical fiber cable, switch and router devices. 

What Layer 1 describes: Sending raw bits of 0 and 1 over a physical medium. It also defines voltages, frequencies and types of single. 
For cyber security, wire tapping (recording signals), jamming signals, and cutting off physical connections is considered a layer 1 attack

Layer 2

This layer deals with transfering data between devices that are on the same local network, meaning devices that's transfering from the switches, ethernet cables and wifi access point. It is the policy for talking over the signals. We can picture it as a local delivery system inside your office. 

Another important term to know is Network Segment: A batch of computers that have the same network channel or they are in the same network group.  For example, 5 computers that are connected to a switch or in the same wifi.

The technologies in layer 2 have protocols such how the devices can relay information over a shared medium or channel. The number 802.11 represents wireless networks and for ethernet, it's 802.3 

At layer 2, we also have Mac addresses that are exclusive assigned to a device. A mac address contains 6 bytes (48 bits) and are written in hexadecimal. Format is AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF and they are implemented in a exclusive network card. The first 3 bytes of a mac address identifies vendors/companies and the last 3 bytes are special identifier of the device.
