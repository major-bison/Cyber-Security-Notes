The OSI Model was created as a standard for different computer networks to talk with each other. 
It breaks networking into 7 layers that assists us how data travels from one device to another.

Layer 1 - Physical (my understand)

The physical manifestation of network Connection. It refers to hardware and signals that they carry ( eletical wires, radio signals, Bluetooth, optical lasers) that uses binary digits
or in bits to transfer data. Examples include optical fiber cable, switch and router devices. 

What Layer 1 describes: Sending raw bits of 0 and 1 over a physical medium. It also defines voltages, frequencies and types of single. 
For cyber security, wire tapping (recording signals), jamming signals, and cutting off physical connections is considered a layer 1 attack
