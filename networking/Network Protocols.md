TLS is a transport-layer cryptographic protocol that ensures confidentiality and integrity by encrypting data between a client and server, 
protecting it from packet sniffing and tampering on insecure networks.

TLS provides two main guarantees: 1) Confidentiality and 2) Integrity  

1) External people should not be able to access your data and it's also encryped.  
2) With integrity, no one can modify the data and tampering is usually detected

Without TLS, Online shopping and banking would be unsafe to use. Emails and text messages could be altered or read
